## Create a new environment

To create a new conda environment, use the following command:

```bash
conda create --name myenv
```

Replace `myenv` with the name you want for your environment. You can also specify the Python version:

```bash
conda create --name myenv python=3.8
```

Alternatively, you can create an environment at a specific path using the `-p` option:

```bash
conda create -p /path/to/myenv
```

Replace `/path/to/myenv` with your desired path. You can also specify the Python version:

```bash
conda create -p /path/to/myenv python=3.8
```

## Set environment variables for a specific environment

To set environment variables for a specific conda environment, use the `conda env config vars set` command. For example:

```bash
conda env config vars set MY_VAR=value
```

Replace `MY_VAR` and `value` with your desired variable name and value.

Activate the environment to apply the changes:

```bash
conda activate myenv
```

To view the environment variables set for the active environment, use:

```bash
conda env config vars list
```

To unset an environment variable, use:

```bash
conda env config vars unset MY_VAR
```

Replace `MY_VAR` with the name of the variable you want to unset.

For more details, refer to the [official conda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands/env/config/vars/index.html).

## Example: Setting PYTHONPATH

To set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable for a specific conda environment, use the following command:

```bash
conda env config vars set PYTHONPATH=/path/to/your/modules
```

Replace `/path/to/your/modules` with the path you want to add to `PYTHONPATH`.

Activate the environment to apply the changes:

```bash
conda activate myenv
```

To verify that `PYTHONPATH` has been set, you can list the environment variables:

```bash
conda env config vars list
```

## Delete an environment

To delete a conda environment, use the `conda remove` command with the `--name` option. For example:

```bash
conda remove --name myenv --all
```

Replace `myenv` with the name of the environment you want to delete. The `--all` flag ensures that all packages in the environment are removed.

Alternatively, if you created the environment at a specific path, use the `-p` option:

```bash
conda remove -p /path/to/myenv --all
```

Replace `/path/to/myenv` with the path to the environment you want to delete.

For more details, refer to the [official conda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands/remove.html).
