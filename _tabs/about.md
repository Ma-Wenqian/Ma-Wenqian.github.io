## Welcome to Wenqian Ma's Webpage!

Hello, my name is Wenqian Ma (马文千), and I am a PhD student in Construction Engineering and Management at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). Previously, I completed my Master's in Civil Engineering at South China University of Technology (SCUT), where I gained expertise in 3D printing technology and parametric design. I believe that integrating parametric design with programming can significantly decrease the workload in engineering.
